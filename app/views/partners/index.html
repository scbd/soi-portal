					One of the core strengths of SOI is its wide range of partners and the opportunity to share and build
					upon the many experiences, knowledge, networks and resources of these partners to achieve common goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					SOI partners share:
					<ul class="text">
						<li>A Common Vision;</li>
						<li>Coherent and/or Complementary Goals and Objectives; and</li>
						<li>A Commitment to Share (e.g., knowledge, expertise, experiences, human resources, financial resources, networks, time, logistic support, etc.)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					SOI partners compose a wide range of global, regional or national institutions/programmes/initiatives,
					who share the vision of SOI and provide various types of in-kind contributions to contribute to the
					mission of SOI. In-kind contributions can include, for example, provisioning of scientific and/or
					technical expertise, contribution of relevant materials, and hosting of workshops and events, among
					other types of support. In addition to those that provide in-kind support, SOI partners also entail
					those countries or organizations that participate in SOI activities (workshops, training, etc.), work to
					enhance implementation in their respective regions/countries/communities by using tools, resources and
					knowledge gained through involvement in SOI, and commit to share their experiences, knowledge, and
					lessons learned through SOI for the benefit of CBD Parties and other SOI partners. In this way, SOI
					creates an iterative process whereby recipients of capacity building resources provided through SOI
					enhance their implementation, then develop their own experiences, lessons, and knowledge to share with
					others through SOI.
