			    <p>Around the world, efforts are under way to improve conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal biodiversity. However, there has been inadequate focus on the holistic aspects of capacity needs with regards to oceans and marine life therein.</p>
			    <p>The Sustainable Ocean Initiative builds on these efforts, resources, and experiences by providing a holistic and strategic framework through which to catalyze partnerships, build on lessons learned and knowledge gained, and facilitate improved coordination and two-way dialogue to address these capacity needs to support countries in their efforts to achieve the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) in marine and coastal areas. The Sustainable Ocean Initiative focuses centrally on facilitating partnerships to link various initiatives and ensure that the sum of these efforts are greater than its parts. </p>

			    <p>Aligning its vision with the KMGBF’s Vision of “living in harmony with nature”, the approach of the Sustainable Ocean Initiative focuses on:</p>
			    <ul class="text">
			    	<li>Achieving a <span class="important">balance between sustainable use and conservation</span> and the promotion of flexible and diverse approaches;</li>
					<li><span class="important">Identifying best practices</span>, facilitating <span class="important">information sharing</span>, and <span class="important">learning from experiences</span>;</li>
					<li><span class="important">Creating partnerships</span> that can provide for targeted capacity building, training, technical assistance and learning exchange;</li>
					<li>Providing for <span class="important">two-way communication</span> among policymakers, scientific communities and local stakeholders;</li>
					<li>Facilitating the <span class="important">provision of guidance and guidelines to support efforts to achieve global goals and targets for biodiversity;</span> and</li>
					<li>Improving the <span class="important">scientific basis for their implementation</span>.</li>
			    </ul>

			    <p>By addressing these key aspects of capacity, SOI aims to build the groundwork and foundation for long-term, effective and adaptive implementation.</p>
