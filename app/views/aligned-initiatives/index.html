					<h3>Blue Solutions</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="textbox">
					<p>
						Blue Solutions provides a global knowledge network and capacity development platform to collate, share and generate solutions for effective management and equitable governance of our planet’s marine and coastal living spaces. Blue Solutions is implemented by the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) in direct partnership with GRID-Arendal, IUCN and UNEP. Funding for the initiative, which lasts from 2013 to 2018, is provided by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) through its International Climate Initiative (ICI).
					</p>
					<p>
						Since 2013 Blue Solutions is a partner of the Sustainable Ocean Initiative as part of the German contribution to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Strategic Plan for Biodiversity. Similar to the SOI, Blue Solutions seeks to build on existing best practices to facilitate capacity development for on-the-ground implementation and, at the same time, foster the upscaling of promising solutions via policy processes.
					</p>
					<p>
						SOI and Blue Solutions are therefore collaborating on strategic processes and joining forces to support sustainable development in the marine and coastal realm. The cooperation is focused on the following areas of action:
						<ul class="text">
							<li>Enabling the sharing and adaptation of solutions by convening solution providers and innovators in face-to-face meetings and via an online solutions exchange.</li>
							<li>Enhancing capacities for implementing solutions by developing and offering a series of training modules, e.g. on Marine Spatial Planning (MSP).</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>French Marine Protected Areas Agency</h3>
				</div>
			    <div class="textbox">
					<p>
						<strong>Background</strong><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						The Agence des aires marines protégées (French Marine Protected Areas Agency) is a governmental
						organization dedicated to the protection of marine environments.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was created by law on April 14, 2006, under the governance of the Ministry of Ecology,
						Sustainable Development and Energy. Its headquarters are in Brest, Brittany, at the westernmost
						tip of the country. It is represented on all three coastlines of the French mainland, and in the
						French overseas. It was pivotal in the creation of the six French marine nature parks: Iroise,
						Mayotte, Golfe du Lion, Glorieuses, Estuaires Picards et Mer d’Opale, and recently the creation
						of the Coral Sea marine park in New Caledonia which is the biggest marine protected area in the
						world (1.3 million km2).
					</p>
					<p>
						The Agency’s responsibilities and objectives include:
						<ul class="text">
							<li>Supporting public policies for the creation and management of marine protected areas in waters under French jurisdiction around the globe;</li>
							<li>Coordinating France’s network of marine protected areas;</li>
							<li>Providing technical and financial support for marine nature parks; and</li>
							<li>Reinforcing French involvement in international negotiations on the sea, notably through regional seas conventions in the Caribbean, the Northeast Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific and the Antarctic.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Activities Related to SOI</strong><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						The conclusions of the Third International Congress on Marine Protected Areas (IMPAC3,
						Marseille, 2013), based on the Ajaccio Ministerial Statement have shown interest in continuing
						to support the Sustainable Ocean Initiative and its efforts to facilitate the achievement of
						Aichi Biodiversity Target 11. The French MPA Agency’s contribution to this initiative also meets
						the objectives of strengthening the France’s international presence and participation in
						international efforts that affect marine protected areas at the global and regional scale.
					</p>
					<p>
						The French MPA Agency is focusing its partnership with SOI in two strategic areas for marine
						biodiversity, the South Pacific and the Western Indian Ocean. This partnership shall focus on
						conducting technical workshops to improve the capacity of regional cooperation to achieve Aichi
						Target 11 and other Aichi Targets (including Aichi Targets 6 and 10) consistently in these two
						priority areas. These workshops will be part of the international agenda of the Nairobi
						Convention and the Commission of the Indian Ocean or the Regional Environment Programme Pacific
						(SPREP) and PACIOCEA initiative.

					<p><h3>IOC-UNESCO OceanTeacher Global Academy (OTGA)</h3></p>
					<p style="margin:0 0 15px 20px"><img style="margin-right:45px" src="app/images/logo-coi.jpg" /><img style="margin-right:45px" src="app/images/logo-iode.png" /><img style="margin-right:45px" src="app/images/logo-ot.png" />

					<p>
						<strong>Background</strong><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						The OceanTeacher Global Academy (OTGA) is a project of IOC-UNESCO’s International Oceanographic Data and information Exchange (IODE) Programme and provides a tool and a framework for not only IODE’s capacity development activities, but also those of other IOC programmes such as Coastal and Marine Management and Planning, Harmful Algal Bloom and the Tsunami Warning System.
					</p>
					<p>
						Building upon over 30 years of IODE experience in Capacity Development, the OTGA is currently establishing a network of Regional Training Centres (RTCs) across the world. Currently five RTCs are formally established (Belgium, Colombia, India, Kenya and Malaysia) while 5 others are still candidate RTC’s (China, Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa, USA). One of the main features of OceanTeacher is its Content Management System, the OceanTeacher e-Learning Platform, that hosts all training contents. This platform allows all training resources to be made available online and shared by all RTCs and encourage the use of multiple languages (e.g. Spanish, French, etc.) and local or regional case studies in order to better address local and regional training needs. Although face to face (classroom) training is the main learning environment, the OceanTeacher e-Learning Platform can also support blended learning and exclusive online training. Additionally, videos of ‘key-note lectures’ and demos are all published online. An interesting component of OTGA is the use of videoconferencing to connect the various RTCS with each other during training courses and allows remote participation of lecturers.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Activities</strong><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						SOI and OTGA are collaborating namely through the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), e.g. by providing and facilitating training on marine biodiversity data management best practices and the use of GIS and OBIS for marine spatial planning. A course on marine spatial planning for marine protected areas has been developed both in English and Spanish in 2015 and this course is utilized in a number of the SOI capacity development workshops (see <a href="http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/course/view.php?id=217">http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/course/view.php?id=217</a> and <a href="http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/course/view.php?id=218">http://classroom.oceanteacher.org/course/view.php?id=218</a>).
					</p>
					<p>
						The OTGA project is managed by the UNESCO-IOC Project Office for IODE, based in Ostend (Belgium). Funding is provided by the Government of Flanders (Belgium) through the Flanders-UNESCO Science Trust Fund (FUST), as well as through support from the RTCs, including in-kind contributions by the many expert lecturers.

					<h3>Network of Managers of Marine Protected Areas in the Mediterranean (MedPAN)</h3>
				</div>
					<div class="textbox">
					<p>
						<strong>Background</strong><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Since 1990, the MedPAN network has brought together the managers of Mediterranean marine protected areas (MPAs) and has supported them in their management activities. In 2008, MedPAN became a legally independent organization with international governance and a permanent Secretariat in Marseille, France. Currently, the MedPAN organization has 61 members (MPA managers) and 39 partners in 18 Mediterranean countries.
					</p>
					<p>
						The MedPAN network's mission is to promote the sustainability and operation of the network of MPAs in the Mediterranean. To achieve this, MedPAN has developed, through a partnership approach, a 2013-2017 strategy with 3 main elements:
					</p>
					<p><u>1- Being a network for knowledge, information, anticipation and synthesis:</u><br />
						Knowledge helps to reinforce MPA capacity to improve their management and to give support to policymaking on a local, national or regional level. MedPAN has developed, together with the Regional Activity Centre for Mediterranean Specially Protected Areas (RAC/SPA), the Mediterranean MPA database (MAPAMED) and the Mediterranean MPA status, which provide up-to-date scientific and technical information to support management.
					</p>
					<p><u>2- Reinforcing the vitality of the network, interactivity between members and building their capacity for effective management of MPAs:</u><br />
						In support of long-term capacity-building for Mediterranean MPAs developed with the RAC/SPA and WWF-Mediterranean, MedPAN organizes thematic annual experience-sharing workshops, exchange visits and trainings, produces operational tools to spread lessons learnt, brings direct support to MPA managers through calls for small projects, and finally, provides updates on MPA management achievements through an e-newsletter.
					</p>
					<p><u>3- Reinforcing the MedPAN network’s sustainability, prominence, governance and resources:</u><br />
						MedPAN works to bring together the voices of managers at the European, Mediterranean and international level to facilitate the bottom-up approach and better consider issues at the local level during decision-making processes. In 2012, MedPAN, together with RAC/SPA organized the first Forum of MPAs in the Mediterranean, which brought together 300 participants. The 2012 Forum developed a common vision and set a new strategic roadmap to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in the Mediterranean. The 2nd Forum of MPAs in the Mediterranean in 2016 will assess the progress made and what needs to be done to effectively reach the 2020 target of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11.
					</p>
					<p>
						Through sharing of information and best practices, monitoring support, capacity building, facilitating dialogue between decisionmakers, scientists, the private sector and conservation managers, MedPAN is fully aligned with the approach of the Sustainable Ocean Initiative in the  Mediterranean.
